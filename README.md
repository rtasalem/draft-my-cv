# Draft My CV
Status: WIP<br>

A CV (resume) generator that takes in information such as contact details, education, work experience, projects and builds a ready to download CV using the [University of Harvard's Mignone Center for Career Success Bullet Point Resume Template](https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/bullet-point-resume-template/), often regarded as one of the best CV/resume templates.

Once your CV has been generated, you can download it as a Word document or a PDF, ready to submit alongside any job or internship applications.

This application is intended to cut down the time taken to create a structured, clear, and well-crafted CV for anyone who is currently job hunting. Good luck!
