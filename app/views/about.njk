        <strong>Draft My CV</strong> is a tool for anyone currently going through the process of 
        <strong>job hunting</strong> or building their CV. This project was created as a way to quickly 
        generate a well-structured CV (or resume) to cut out all the hours spent trying to put together
        a great CV.<br><br> Simply enter your details, hit <strong>Submit</strong>, and your CV will
        be ready to download as either a Word document or PDF which are the most compatible formats
        when submitting as part of a job application. Job hunting is far from a fun process, so
        I hope this makes the process a little easier. <strong>Good luck!</strong>
