# TO-DO

## Frontend
- [ ] Ensure titles match up with what is on the submit/home page, specifically for the Personal Information heading

## Features
- [ ] Input validation using Joi
- [ ] Download your CV as a Word Document or PDF file

## Accessibility
- [ ] Should be available as a Docker image that can be pulled from DockerHub
- [ ] Should be hosted online
- [ ] Make elements responsive e.g. buttons -> see Bulma docs

## Refactoring
- [ ] Tidy up references to each route in server (can constants + a forEach loop be used?)
- [ ] Add appropriate spacing to .njk files - mirror how the UI actually looks
